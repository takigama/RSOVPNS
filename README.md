# RSOVPNS
Real Simple OpenVPN Server is a simple chuck of software (primarily at this time aimed at openwrt)
that provides a simple gui to an OpenVPN service. 

What it has is:
- simple gui for config
- multi-factor authentication (radius, local password and google authenticator)
- inbuild Google Authicator server (on-box two-factor auth)
- simple controls for starting/stopping/managing OpenVPN

Its NOT PRODUCTION WORTHY by any stretch - in fact, running it would be very detrimental to your
routers health.

My test beds are an AR9331 (GL.inet) router
