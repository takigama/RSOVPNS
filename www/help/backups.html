<div class='mybodysubheading'>Backups</div><hr>
This section allows you to control the way backups are taken of your OpenVPN service<br>
<li> The first line specifies the latest local backup taken. The link to the right of this allows you to create a new one or restore the current one (note that creating a new backup overwrites the old one and restoring will overwrite your data).
<li> If a backup exists it can be downloaded with the download link (note that the backup is encrypted with the password specified in the configuration)
<li> Remote restore allows you to upload a backup and restore it over your current data.
<li> The scheduled backup for allows you to take regular backups and have them emailed to the account that is specified in the form.
