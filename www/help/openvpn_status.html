This section allows you to control the OpenVPN service and test emails<br>
<li> Click the stop/start link to start or stop the service (note that this disconnects any connected users)
<li> The number of users specifies the number of users currently connected to the servier (mouse over the number to show the usernames of all connected users)
<li> Sending a test email will check wether your email service is working (why this is on this particular page will make more sense at later date)
